            <strong>Admin can select a player to be a captain.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are exactly two players flagged as captain, they will be
            captain, (league)MMR sorting is ignored in this case.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>Extra Flagged Captains Ignored:</strong> If more than two
            players are flagged as captains, only the top two (by MMR) are used;
            the others remain available for drafting.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>Fallback on (league)MMR:</strong> When there arenâ€™t enough
            flagged players (one or none), it uses the highest (league)MMR from
            the remaining players to fill in the gap.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="balanced-shuffle" className="mb-12">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
            HOW BALANCED SHUFFLE WORKS
          </h1>
          <p>
            The balanced shuffle algorithm examines all possible ways to split
            the list of players into two teams. It calculates the total
            (league)MMR for each possible division and selects the combination
            with the smallest difference between teams.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            If multiple nearly balanced combinations are found (i.e. with a
            difference below a set threshold), the algorithm randomly selects
            one to ensure fairness. This process helps create teams that are as
            evenly matched as possible.
