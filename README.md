# DISCORD OAUTH SETTINGS

You can find the values for:

AUTH_SECRET
AUTH_DISCORD_ID
AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET

1. Generating AUTH_SECRET
   Run the following command in your terminal inside the project directory:

npx auth secret
This will generate a secret key, which you should add to your .env.local file like this:

AUTH_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here 2. Finding AUTH_DISCORD_ID and AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET
These come from your Discord Developer Portal:

Go to Discord Developer Portal.
Log in and select your application (or create one if you haven't).
In the "OAuth2" section, copy:
Client ID â†’ This is your AUTH_DISCORD_ID
Client Secret â†’ This is your AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET
Paste them into your .env.local file:
AUTH_DISCORD_ID=your_discord_client_id_here
AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret_here 3. Setting Up the .env.local File
Now your .env.local file should look like this:

# Certificate for (HTTPS) commands

mkdir -p letsencrypt
chmod 600 letsencrypt/acme.json
touch letsencrypt/acme.json
chmod 600 letsencrypt/acme.json
